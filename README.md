As a group, we have decided to do a trend analysis of Spotify data involving many tracks by a single artist that have changed over time (yearly) in terms of their acoustic, danceable, energetic, instrumental, live, loud, speechy, tempo, and valence aspects.

Currently, the strategy is to store data for a few years before connecting the MySQL DB server to a BI tool. Example: Probably Tableau or Power BI and planned to export the data by establishing the connection to the DB server, developing a dashboard for an artist with individual graphical representations for certain audio feature data, and generating the visualization across the duration (yearly).
